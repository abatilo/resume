# resume
This repository has a CI pipeline setup for it which ensures that you can
always find my most up to date version of my resume at
[https://www.aaronbatilo.dev/resume](https://www.aaronbatilo.dev/resume).

I wanted to learn how to use LaTeX and resumes seem to be the easiest thing to
use it for.

My resume template is heavily based on
[this](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume).
